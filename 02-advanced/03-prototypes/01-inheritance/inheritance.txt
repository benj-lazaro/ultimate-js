Inheritance
-----------
- Inheritance is one of the core conceprs of object-oriented programming (OOP)
    - Wherein it enables an object
    - To take on properies and/or methods of another object

    - This makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application


- In the classical definition of Inheritance
    - A direct / sub / child class inherits the properties and methdos of the base / super / parent class

    - The inheritance relationship between the two is referred as "is-a"
        - e.g. The relationship between circle child class and the shape parent class
        - Can be described as "circle IS A shape"

    - NOTE: JavaScript do NOT have classes, ONLY objects
        - This is where "prototypical inheritance" comes into the picture
