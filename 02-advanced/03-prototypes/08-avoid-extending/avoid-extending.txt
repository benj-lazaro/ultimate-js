Avoid Extending Built-in Objects
--------------------------------
- Despite how easy it is to add new properties / methods to a existing object
    - Do NOT modify (extend) the built-in objects in JavaScript
    - Do NOT modify objects that you do NOT own   
    - Do NOT add, remove or modify the built-in object's properties and/or methods


- Doing so creates of sorts of issues
    - With a 3rd-party library that might be dependent on a built-in object's properties / methods
    - With a 3rd-party library's extended built-in object
    - With JavaScript developers' future implementation of a built-in object
