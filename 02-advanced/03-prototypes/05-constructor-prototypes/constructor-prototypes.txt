Constructor Prototypes
----------------------
- Every object in JavaScript (except for the root Object) has a root parent or prototype
    - To get an object's prototype (parent)
        - Use the method Object.getPrototypeOf()
            - 1st parameter = target object

        - Returns the same content when accessing the "__proto__" property of the object


- A constructor function has their own "prototype" property
    - This refers to the object that will be used as parent object
    - To the objects that will be created from this constructor function
