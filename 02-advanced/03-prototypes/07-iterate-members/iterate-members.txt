Iterating Instance and Prototype Members
----------------------------------------
- The Objects.keys() method
    - ONLY return instance members of an object


- The for..in loop
    - Returns all members (BOTH instance and prototype) of an object


- The .hasOwnProperty() method
    - It is a method of Object instances

    - Returns a boolean value
        - Indicating whether an object has the specified property (passed argument value)
        - As its own property (i.e. instance member) 
        - As opposed to inheriting it (i.e. prototype member)

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)


    Syntax:

    hasOwnProperty(prop)
