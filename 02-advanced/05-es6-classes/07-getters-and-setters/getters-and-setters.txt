Getters and Setters
--------------------
- To implement a getter in an ES6 class
    - Define a new prototype member method
    - Use the keyword "get"
    - Followed by the name of the private property to read from
    - Ends with a ()

    - Inside the method
        - Use the "return" keyword
        - The name of the private property (PREFIXED with an underscore)
        - Followed by a .get() method
        - Passing "this" as argument value

    - To execute the getter
        - Treat it like accessing a public property 
        - Instead that of a method (i.e. dropping the pair of "()" at the end of the statment)


- To define a setter in an ES6 class
    - Define a new prototype member method
    - Use the keyword "set"
    - Followed by the name of the private property to update its assigned value
    - Ends with a () with the parameter variable inside that will hold the new value

    - Inside the method
        - Perform a validation on the argument value reiceved
        
        - The name of the private property (PREFIXED with an underscore)
        - Followed by a .set() method
        - Passing "this" and the parameter variable as argument values

    - To execute the setter
        - Treat it like assigning a new value to a public property
        - Instead that of a method (i.e. dropping the pair of "()" at the end of the statment)
