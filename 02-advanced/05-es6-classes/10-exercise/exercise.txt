Exercise
--------
- Implement a stack data structure using ES6 classes
    - It has two (2) essential operations (methods)
        - push  = add an object into the stack
        - pop   = remove an object from the stack


- The class Stack
    - It has an instance member
        - count = keeps track on the number of items / objects in the stack


    - It has prototype members
        - peek()    = similar to pop, returns the object on top of the stack but does NOT removes it
        - pop()     = removes an object from top of the stack
        - push()    = add an object on top of the stack

        - Attempt to use pop() on an empty stack
            - Throws an error "Error: Stack is empty"

        - Attempt to use peek() on an empty stack
            - Throws an error "Error: Stack is empty"
