Static Methods
--------------
- In classical OOP languages, there are two (2) types of methods
    - Instance Methods
        - Available on an instance of a class (i.e. object)

    - Static Methods
        - Available on the class itself
            - They are NOT available to the instance of the class (i.e. object)
        
        - They are used to create utility functions that are NOT tied to a particular object
            - Takes an input and returns something


- To define a Static Method
    - Use the "static" keyword
    - Followed by the name of the method
            

- To access a Static Method
    - NO need to create an instance of a class    
    - Use the dot notation / syntax
        - Class name
        - Static method name

        <class_name>.<static_method_name>();
