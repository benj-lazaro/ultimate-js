Inheritance
-----------
- To implement inheritance in ES6 class
    - Declare the parent class

    - Declare the child class
        
    - Use the keyword "extends"
        - After the child class name
        - Before the parent class name
        
        - In order to inherit the properties and/or methods of the parent class
            - NO need to reset the prototype
            - NO need to reset the constructor


- If both the parent and child class have their respective constructor functions
    - It triggers a "ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this'..."

    - Inside the child class's constructor function
        - Use the "super" keyword to reference the parent object
        - Call it like a function (i.e. "super()")
        - Pass the required argument value(s)

        - Add instance members of the child class next
