Hoisting
--------
- In JavaScript, there are two ways to define a function
    - Function Declaration       
        - They are hoisted = implicitly raised to the top of the code base at run-time
        - They can be called even BEFORE its own declaration

    - Function Expression
        - They are NOT hoisted
        - They can NOT be called BEFORE its own expression


- In JavaScript, there are two ways to define a class
    - Class Declaration
        - Simplier and cleaner

    - Class Expression
        - NOT commonly used

    - Both are NOT hoisted like functions
        - Referencing a class to create an object PRIOR to its declaration or expression
        - Triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError"
