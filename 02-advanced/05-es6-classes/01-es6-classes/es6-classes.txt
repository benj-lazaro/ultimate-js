ES6 Classes
-----------
- Unlike regular classes in languages such as C# or Java
    - JavaScript classes are syntatic sugar over
        - Prototypical inheritance
        - Constructor functions

    - It offers a cleaner and simpler way of
        - Creating objects
        - Implementing inheritance


- The constructor() method within the body if a class 
    - Is used to initialize objects
    - It is also where instance members (properties/methods) of an object is located

    - Prototype members are defined
        - Outside the constructor() method
        - Within the body of the class
        - The "function" keyword is removed
        - Directly implement the name & body of the method
