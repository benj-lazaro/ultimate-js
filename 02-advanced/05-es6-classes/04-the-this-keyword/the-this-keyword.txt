The "this" Keyword
------------------
- The value of "this" depends on how a method is being executed
    - Using the Method Call
        - The value of "this" points to the associated object
        - This is due to calling a method on an object

    - Using the Function Call   
        - Storing the reference of an object's method in a constant or variable
            - Then calling it as a stand-alone function

        - The value of "this" points to the global "window" object in JavaScript
            - Or "global" in Nodejs
    

- The behavior of "this" keyword also changes when in "Strict Mode"
    - To enable "use strict"

    - Calling an object's method as a stand-alone function
        - The "this" will have the value of "undefined"
        - Instead of pointing to the global "window" object

    - This to prevent from accidentally modifying the global "window" object
        - As this is considered BAD pratice


- Inside a JavaScript ES6 class
    - The value of "this" points to "undefined"

    - By default, the body of a JavaScript class are executed in "Strict Mode"
        - This to prevent from accidentally modifying the global "window" object
