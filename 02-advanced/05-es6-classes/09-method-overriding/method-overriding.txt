Method Overriding
-----------------
- It is when a method in the parent (or base) class
    - Want to change its implementation in the child (or direct / derived) class 


- To override a parent's method in the child class
    - Use the same name as that of the parent's method
    - Implement a different version
    - Save changes
    
    - This works due to prototypical inheritance
        - JavaScript Engine looks up within the child class first
        - If the corresponding method is found, it is executed

        - Otherwise, it moves up to the parent class
        - If the corresponding method is found, it is executed

        - Otherwise, moves up the prototypical inheritance path
        - Until it reaches the root object


- To override and reuse a parent's method in the child class
    - Use the same name as that of the parent's method
    - Inside the method
        - Use the "super" keyword
        - Followed by the name of the parent's method (Use dot notation)
        
    - Implement addtiional code changes
    - Save changes
