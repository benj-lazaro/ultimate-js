Exercise: Stopwatch
-------------------
- Design a stopwatch object
    - Use a constructor function to define a new object

    - The object has a few members
        - duration  = property; default value of 0
        - reset     = method
        - start     = method
        - stop      = method

    - The duration property
        - Initially has the value of 0
        - It holds the number of seconds the between the start() & stop() methods were called

    - The start() method starts the stopwatch
        - This method can NOT be called twice
        - Otherwise, throws an error "Stopwatch has alredy started."

    - The stop() method stops the stopwatch
        - This method can NOT be called twice
        - Otherwise, throws an error "Stopwatch is not started."

    - The reset() method resets the value of the duration property back to 0
