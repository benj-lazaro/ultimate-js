Constructors
------------
- The different between a factory and constructor functions
    - Factory function
        - Declares a regular standalone function using the CamelCase naming convention

        - Uses the Object Literal Notation / Syntax to create the object

        - Explicitly returns the object using the "return" statement


    - Constructors function
        - Declares a regular standalone function using the Pascal naming convention

        - Uses the "new" keyword to create an empty object

        - Uses the "this" keyword when defining a property and method of the object
            - "this" refers to the object associated to the current line of code

        - Implicitly returns the object


- Which one to use
    - Boils down to personal preference
        - C# and Java developers    = constructor function
        - Other developers          = factory function

    - Best to be familiar with both patterns as a developer
        - Dev teams and project utilize either patterns when creating an object
