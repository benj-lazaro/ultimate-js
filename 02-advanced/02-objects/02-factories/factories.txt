Factories
---------
- Creating multiple copies of the same object using Object Literal Notation / Syntax
    - Can be an ISSUE IF the source object has at least one (1) method
    - A bug in that method will be replicated throughout its copies


- The solution is to use a factory function
    - It eliminates the issue presented using Object Literal Notation / Syntax

    - NOTE: If property name & assigned variable (holding the value) have identical names
        - Remove the variable name
