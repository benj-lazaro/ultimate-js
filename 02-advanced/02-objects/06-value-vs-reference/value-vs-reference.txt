Values vs Reference Types
-------------------------
- JavaScript has two categories of data Types
    - Value (primitives)
        - Refers to the actual value
        - e.g. boolean, number, string, symbol, undefined, null

        - When a value is copied to another variable
            - The values in the said variables are independent of each other

    - Primitives are copied by their VALUE


    - Reference (objects)
        - Refers to the location of the actual value in memory
        - e.g. array, function, object

        - When a reference value is assigned to a variable
            - The actual value is NOT stored
            - The address (reference) of the value in memory is stored

        - When a reference value is copied to anther variable
            - The location of the value in memory is copied
            - Therefore, both variables are referencing to the SAME value in memory
            
            - Any changes made in the first variable
                - Will be reflected on the succeeding variables

    - Objects are copied by their REFERENCE
