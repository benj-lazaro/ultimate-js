Adding or Removing Properties
-----------------------------
- Objects in JavaScript are dynamic
    - You can add or remove properties during the program's execution

    - The bracket notation [..] can be useful when adding a property dynamically
        - But have NO idea what will be the name of the property ahead of time

        - Or on property name that are NOT valid identifiers
            - special characters in-between words
            - whitespace in-between words


- Use the "delete" operation to dynamically remove a property
