Getters and Setters
-------------------
- To read from and write to a "private" property of an object
    - Use the Object.defineProperty() method to define a getter and/or setter functions
    
    - To define a Getter and/or Setter function
        - That reads and sets, respectively the value of a "private" property

    - The method requires the following argument values
        - 1st parameter = "this" (object where the getter/setter function is/are defined)
        - 2nd parameter = name of "private" property to read from / write to
        - 3rd parameter = an object containing a getter and/or setter function(s)

    - Then returns the object

    - PROS: validation check can be implemented inside a setter function

- Scope vs Closures of an inner function
    - Closure is able to access both local and parent defined variables
        - When the inner function terminates
            - Local variables get terminated
            - Access & state of  the parent variables remains in memory

    - Scope is limited to access its local variables
        - When the inner function terminates
            - Local variables get terminated
