Enumerating Properties
----------------------
- To iterate over (enumerate) properties (and methods) of an object
    - Use the for..in loop
    - Use the bracket notation [..] to retrieve the respective values
    
    - Use the "typeof" operator to retrieve the properties ONLY
    - In conjunction with an "if" statement


- Alternatively, use Object.keys()
    - Pass the object as an argument value
    - Returns the property and method names as elements of an array

    - CONS: unable to separate properties from methods


- To determine the existence of a property in an object
    - Use the "in" operator
    - In conjunction with an "if" statement
