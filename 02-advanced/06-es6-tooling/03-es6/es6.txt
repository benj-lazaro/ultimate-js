ES6 Modules
-----------
- To export a module using ES6 Module Format
    - Use the "export" keyword prior to the name of the class to be exported

    - The "export" keyword is used to export one or more objects


- To import the module on the main codebase
    - Use the keyword "import"
        - To "import" one or more objects from the modules

    - Implement using the following statement

    import {<name_of_exported_class>} from "<relative_path_name>/<module_name_w/o_the_extension>"

    - NOTE: A "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outisde a module" is expected
        - Using Webpack will address this issue


- A tentative workaround for the "SyntaxError" solely for demo purposes (NOT production) is as follows:
    - On the <script> tag of the index.html file
        - Add the HTML attribute "type"
            - Assign the value of "module"

    - On the "import" statement of the app.js file
        - Include the target module's filename extension (i.e. ".js")

    - Reload the index.html file
