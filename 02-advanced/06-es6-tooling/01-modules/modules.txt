Modules
-------
- Splitting JavaScript code into multiple files
    - Instead of one huge codebase
    - Each of these files is referred as a module


- Advantages of using modules
    - Maintainability
        - Ease of maintaing a codebase organized into modules
    
    - Re-use
        - Re-use of modules in different parts of an application as well as in different applications
        
    - Abstracts code
        - Hides some of the application's complexity in a module
        - Expose only the essentials


- Brief history of modules in JavaScript
    - In ES5, it did NOT have the concept of modules
        - The community introduced new syntaxes to define modules known as "module formats"
        
        - Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
            - Primarily used for browser applications
            - Currently used for maintaining legacy applications

        - CommonJS
            - Used in Node.js

        - Universal Module Definition (UMD)
            - Used on both browser and Node.js applications
            - Currently used for maintaining legacy applications

    - As of ES6, natively supports a "module format"
