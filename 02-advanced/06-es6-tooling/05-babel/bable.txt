Babel
-----
- Demonstrates how to install and use Babel
    - Babel requires Nodejs and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed first


- To install:
    - Create the corresponding project folder

    - Using npm, initialize a Node project inside the folder

        npm init --yes

        - Creates a file named "package.json"

    - Install Babel
        - Three packages are required; for this demo, specific versions are given

        npm i babel-cli@6.26.0 babel-core@6.26.0 babel-preset-env@1.6.1 --save-dev

        - Description of each package and flag are as follows
            - babel-cli         = Babel's CLI tool
            - bable-core        = Babel's core (contains the logic for transpiling ES6 code)
            - bable-preset-env  = Handles corresponding plug-ins for every ES6 feature

            - --save-dev        = Flag that install packages as development dependencies
                                = They will NOT be included on production

        
- To use:
    - Use a text editor and open "package.json" file

    - On the "scripts" line, remove the line
        
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

    - Replace it with:

        "bable": "babel --presets env app.js -o build/index.js"

        - NOTE: Make sure that the directory "build" exists
            - This directory will store the translated ES5 code (running on 'strict mode')

    - Save changes and run the CLI command
    
        npm run babel
