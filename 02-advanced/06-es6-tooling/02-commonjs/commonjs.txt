CommonJS Modules
----------------
- Modulize a JavaScript codebase using CommonJS
    - This is the module format used in Nodejs

    - NOTE: Use ES6 modules for front-end web development
        - Modulizing a JavaScript codebase for the browser

    - By default, everything define inside a module is considered to be private
        - It is NOT accessible to the outside unless it is explicitly exported


- Basic rule of thumb about modularity
    - Things that are highly related should go together
        - In software engineering, this is referred to as Cohesion


- To export a module in Nodejs
    - On the module codebase, the last line of code should be:

    module.exports = <class_name>; // Returns the class

    OR

    module.exports.<object_name_1> = <class_name>;
    ...
    module.exports.<object_name_n> = <class_name>;


- To import a module into the main codebase

    const <constant> = require("<relative_path_name>/<module_name_w/o_the_extension_name>");
