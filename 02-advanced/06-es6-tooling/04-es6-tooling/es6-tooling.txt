ES6 Tooling
-----------
- The following tools are ONLY RELEVANT for developing browser applications
    - Transpiler
        - It is a combination of a translator and a compiler

        - It translates ES6 JavaScript code into its ES5 version
            - ES5 JavaScript code is understood by ALL browsers
        
        - Babel is a popular Transpiler
            - Website (https://babeljs.io/)


    - Bundler
        - It combines ALL JavaScript files into a SINGLE file (i.e. bundle)

        - It minifies the bundle
            - Gets rid of comments and whitespaces
            - Uglifies the code (shorten the name of identifiers, classes, functions & more)
            - Reduces the overall file size of the bundle

        - Webpack is a popular bundler
            - Website (https://webpack.js.org/)
