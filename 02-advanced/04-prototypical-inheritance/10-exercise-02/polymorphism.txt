Exercise 02: Polymorphism
-------------------------
- Based on the previous exercise
    - Extend the HtmlSelectElement object
        - Implement a .render() method
            - Accepts an array as argument value

            - Renders items as HTML code
                - Each item is embedded within a pair of <option> tags
                - <option> tags are collectively embedded within a pair of <select> tags


    - Create a new object HtmlImageElement
        - Optionally accepts the source of an image
        - It has instance member
            - src   = source address of image

        - It has a prototype member
            - .focus()

        - It inherits from an instance of HtmlElement
