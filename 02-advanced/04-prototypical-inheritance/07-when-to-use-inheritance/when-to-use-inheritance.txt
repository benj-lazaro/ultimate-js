When To Use Inheritance
-----------------------
- Inheritance addresses the problem of code reuse
    - However, it can make the source code complex and fragile

    - Avoid using inheritance for the sake of using it
        - Particularly on small projects
        - Keept it simple and stupid
        
    - When to use inheritance
        - Start with simple objects

    - When a number of objects share similar features
        - Encapsulate those features inside of a generic object
        - Use inheritance to create new objects

    - However, it may introduce complex / multilevel inheritance hierarchies
        - They are very fragile
        - AVOID creating inheritance hierarchies
        - Keep inheritance hierarchy to ONE LEVEL ONLY


- Favor "Composition" over "Inheritance"
    - Composition offers great flexibility over complex inheritance hierarchies

    - Focuses on features as independent plain JavaScript objects
        - Each with their own properties and/or methods
    
    - Create new objects from a combination of any of these independent objects
        - JavaScript uses Mixins to achieve Composition
