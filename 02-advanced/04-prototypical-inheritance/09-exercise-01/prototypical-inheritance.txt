Exercise 01: Prototypical Inheritance Exercise
----------------------------------------------
- Design two objects
    - HTMLElement
        - It contains 1 instance (own) method named click()
        - It inherits 1 prototype method named focus()
    
    - HtmlSelectElement
        - Optionally receives an array of items

        - If nothing is passed
            - The this.items property will be initialized as an empty array

        - It has the following instance (own) methods
            - addItem()     = Adds an item to the array
            - removeItem()  = Removes an item from the array

        - This object is an instance of HTMLElement object


- Create a new object using a constructor function
