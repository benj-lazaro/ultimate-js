Break and Continue
------------------
- The break statement terminates the current loop or switch statement 
    - Then transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement

    - It can also be used to jump past a labeled statement 
        - When used within that labeled statement

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break)

    Syntax:

    break;
    break label;


- The continue statement terminates execution of the statements 
    - In the current iteration of the current or labeled loop
    - Then continues execution of the loop with the next iteration

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue)

        - It is part of the legacy stuff in JavaScript
        - NOT recommended to use

    Syntax:

    continue;
    continue label;
