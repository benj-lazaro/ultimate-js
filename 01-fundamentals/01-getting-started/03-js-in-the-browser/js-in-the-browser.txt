JavaScript in Browsers
----------------------
- It is best practice to place the <script> tag at the last line within the <body> tag
    - The <script> element is used to refer to JavaScript code

    - Doing so ensures that the element of the HTML document has been rendered
        - Before parsing & executing the JavaScript code

    - Placing the <script> tag at the last line within the <head> tag
        - Will result to a bad user experience

        - The browser might get busy parsing & executing the JavaScript code
            - Before rendering the content of the HTML document

        - Almost always JavaScript code needs to "talk" with elements of the HTML document
            - Important to have them rendered first

        - An exception to this rule are 3rd-party libraries
            - Some libraries require placing the <script> tag within the <head> tag

        - NOTE: A workaround is to use the HTML attribute "defer"
            - This informs the browser to parse & execute JavaScript code
            - ONLY after the HTML document has been parsed
            - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement/defer)

            <script src="app.js" defer></script>


- A JavaScript statement 
    - Is a piece of code that expresses an action to be carried.
    - It is terminated by a semi-color ";"


- A JavaScript comment
    - This is ignored by the JavaScript engine 
    
    - It is purely for documenting the code
        - It explains the why's and how's of a piece of code

    - Single-line comment

        // This is a single line comment


    - Multi-line comment

        /*
            This is 
            a multi-line
            comment
        
        */
