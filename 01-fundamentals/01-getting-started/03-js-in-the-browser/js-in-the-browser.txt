JavaScript in Browser
----------------------
- It is considered best practice placing the HTML <script> element
    - At the last line prior to the closing HTML </body> element

    - The <script> element points to an external JavaScript file 

    - This ensures the that browser have parsed through the entire HTML document 
        - Rendered the content and HTML elements
        - Before parsing and executing the JavaScript code


- Placing the <script> element within the <head>
    - Will LIKELY result to a bad User Experience (UX)

    - The browser MIGHT get busy or stuck parsing and executing the JavaScript code
        - Before it can render the rest of the content and HTML elements

    - Often the JavaScript code NEEDS to "talk" with HTML elements
        - It is IMPORTANT to have the HTML elements rendered first

    - An exception to this "rule" are the 3rd-party libraries
        - Some require placing the <script> element within the <head>


- NOTE: A workaround is using the HTML attribute "defer" in the <script> element
    - This informs the browser to parse and execute the JavaScript code
    - ONLY AFTER the contents and HTML elements have been rendered
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement/defer)

        <script src="app.js" defer></script>


- A JavaScript statement
    - Is a piece of code that expresses an ACTION to be carried
    - A statement is terminated by a semi-colon 


- A JavaScript comment
    - Is a piece of text in the JavaScript code that is IGNORED by the JavaScript Engine
    
    - It is there purely for documenting the code
        - Explains the "why" and "how" of a line of code

    - Two forms of comments
        - Single-line

            // This is a single line comment

        - Multiline

            /* This is 
               a multi-line
               comment
            */
