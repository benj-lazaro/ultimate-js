Logical Operators with Non-Booleans
-----------------------------------
- Logical operators can be used to work with non-Boolean values
    - Returned result is NOT necessarily a Boolean value
    - It depends on the operand's value

    
- If the operand's value is NOT a Boolean value
    - The JavaScript Engine intreprets the value as either "truthy" or "falsy"

    - As soon as the JavaScript Engine encounters a "truthy" value
        - Succeeding evaluation stops and ignore the succeeding statements (i.e. short-circuiting)
        - IMMEDIATELY returns a "truthy" value

    - A "falsy" value
        - 0
        - ""
        - false
        - NaN
        - null
        - undefined

    - A "truthy" value
        - Any value that is NOT "falsy"
