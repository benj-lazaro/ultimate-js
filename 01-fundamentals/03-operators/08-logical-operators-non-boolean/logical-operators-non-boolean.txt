Logical Operators with Non-Booleans
-----------------------------------
- Logical operators can be used to work with non-boolean values
    - The result of a logical operations is NOT necessary a boolean value
    - It depends on the value of the operand


- If the value of the operand is NOT a boolean value
    - JavaScript Engine intreprets it as either truthy or falsy value
        - As soon as the JavaScript Engine encounters a truthy value
        - The evaluation stops & ignores the rest (i.e. short-circuiting)
        - Immediately returns the truthy value

    - Falsy values include:
        - undefined, null, 0, false, "", NaN

    - Truthy
        - Refers to any value that is NOT falsy
