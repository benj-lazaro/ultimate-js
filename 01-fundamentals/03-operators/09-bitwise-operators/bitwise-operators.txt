Bitwise Operators
-----------------
- Bitwise operators are often used on the theorhetical side (of Computer Science)
    - NOT much used on a daily basis

    - They are similar to logical operators BUT work on the individual bits of a value


- Bitwise AND (&)
    - Returns a number or BigInt whose binary representation has a 1 in each bit position
        - For which the corresponding bits of BOTH operands are 1
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_AND)

    Syntax:

    x & y


- Bitwise OR (|)
    - Returns an number or BigInt whose binary representation has a 1 in each bit position
        - For which the corresponding bits of EITHER or BOTH operands are 1
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_OR)

    Syntax:

    x | y


- Bitwise NOT (~)
    - Returns an number or BigInt whose binary representation has a 1 in each bit position
        - For which the corresponding bit of the operand is 0 and a 0 otherwise
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_NOT)

    Syntax:

    ~x


- Bitwise XOR (^)
    - Returns an number or BigInt whose binary representation has a 1 in each bit position
        - For which the corresponding bits of EITHER but NOT BOTH operands are 1
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR)
    
    Syntax:

    x ^ y
