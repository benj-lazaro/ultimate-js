Arithmetic Operators
--------------------
- These are operators used for making calculations
    - Addition          = +
    - Subtraction       = -
    - Multiplication    = *
    - Division          = /
    - Remainder/Modulus = %
    - Exponentiation    = **

        - NOTE: These operators REQUIRE two (2) operands to produce a new value

    - Increment         = ++
    - Decrement         = --

        - Location of these operators on an operand produce different behaviors

        - Placing in front of an operand
            - Increments / decrements the assigned value by 1
            - BEFORE the value is accessed / referenced 

        - Placing at the back of an operand
            - Increments / decrements the assigned value by 1
            - AFTER the value is accessed / referenced
