Arithmetic Operators
--------------------
- These are operators used for making calculations
    - Addition          = +
    - Subtraction       = -
    - Multiplication    = *
    - Division          = /
    - Remainder/Modulus = %
    - Exponentiation    = **

    - These arithmetic operators require two operands to produce a new value


    - Increment         = ++
    - Decrement         = --

    - Depending on the location of the operator 
        - Location being before or after the operand
        - It will behave differently

        - Placing it at the front of the operand
            - Ii increments / decrements the value of the operand by 1
            - Before it is used / referenced on

        - Placing it at the end of the operand
            - It increments / decrements the value of the operand by 1
            - After it is used / referenced on
