Equality Operators
------------------
- JavaScript has two (2) Equality operators 
    - Strict Equality ===
        - It evaluates both data type and value of the operands
        - It is more accurate and precise (RECOMMENDED)

    - Lose Equality ==
        - It evaluates the value of the operands

        - When the operands' values do NOT match
            - JavaScript IMPLICITLY converts the right-hand operand's data type
                - To the data type of the left-hand operand's data type

            - Then check the equality of their values AGAIN
