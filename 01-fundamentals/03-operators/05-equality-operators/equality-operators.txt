Equality Operators
------------------
- JavaScript has two equality operators
    - Strict Equality (===)
        - Evaluates the equality of both operands based on their type AND value
        - Advised to use as it is more precise and accurate


    - Lose Equality (==)
        - Evaluates the equality of both operands based on their value

        - If the both values do NOT match
            - Implicity converts the value of the right-hand operand
            - Then checks if the values are equal
