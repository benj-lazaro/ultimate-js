Hoisting
--------
- The advantage of a declared function
    - It can be called even if they are declared at the latter part of the code base

    - JavaScript Engine automatically moves all function declarations 
        - To the start of the code base at run-time
        - This action is known as Hoisting
        - It is the process of moving function declarations to the top of the file (or code base)

    - Hoisting is NOT possible with an anonymous or named function expression
        - Doing do triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access <function> before initialization"
