Local and Global Scope
----------------------
- The scope is the current context of execution 
    - In which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced
    - If a variable or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use


- JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes
    - Global    = The default scope for all code running in script mode
    - Module    = The scope for code running in module mod
    - Function  = The scope created with a function


- Variables declared with "let" or "const" can belong to an additional scope
    - Block     = The scope created with a pair of curly braces


- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)


- NOTE: In general, avoid defining global scoped variables or constants
    - It is considered bad practice
