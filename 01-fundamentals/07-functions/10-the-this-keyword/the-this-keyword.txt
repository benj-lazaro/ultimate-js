The this Keyword
-----------------
- The "this" keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function
    - In OOP, "this" refers to the object that a method is attached to


- The value of "this" depends on how a function is invoked (i.e. runtime binding); NOT how it is defined
    - If a function is part of an object (i.e. method)
        - The value of "this" refers to that object

    - If a function is a standalone function (NOT part of an object)
        - The value of "this" refers to the global "window" object in non-strict mode (default)
        - The value of "this" is "undefined" in strict mode

        - The value of "this" refers to global in Node.js

    - If a function is a constructor function
        - The value of "this" refers to the object created by the constructor function
        - The "new" operator used by the constructor function creates a new empty object
            - Assigns the value of "this" to the empty object
