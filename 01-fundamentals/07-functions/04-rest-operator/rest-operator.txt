Rest Operator
-------------
- Also known as the Rest Parameter Syntax
    - It allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as a real array

    - NOTE: The rest parameter MUST be the LAST FORMAL Parameter

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)


Syntax:

function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
  // â€¦
}


- In modern JavaScript
    - Rest operator is used for a function with varying amount of parameters 


- NOTE: It similarly looks the same as the spread operator
    - Their differences lies on their function and where they are used

    - Spread operator often used with arrays
        - it "spreads" collection into individual elements

    - Rest operator used on the parameter definition of a function declaration
        - It collects the varying argument values passed
        - Place the "rest" of them as individual elements in a real array
