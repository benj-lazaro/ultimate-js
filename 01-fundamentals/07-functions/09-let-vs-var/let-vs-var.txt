let vs var
----------
- Using the "var" keyword
    - Creates function-scoped variables
    - Best AVOID using it

    - Defining a global variable with "var"
        - Automatically gets attached to the global "window" object as a property
        
        - Global variables of 3rd-party libraries
            - MIGHT clash and override your global variables
            - Causing all sorts of issues


- SIDE NOTE: Globally defined functions ALSO gets attached to the global "window" object


- Using the "let" or "const" keyword
    - Creates block-scoped variable or constant
        - Returns an "Uncaught ReferenceError: <variable> is not defined at.."
        - When accessing a variable / constant outside of its block scope

    - Defining a global variable with "let" or "const"
        - Does NOT get attachd to the global "window" object
