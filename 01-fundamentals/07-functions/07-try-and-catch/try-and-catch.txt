Try and Catch
-------------
- The throw statement throws a user-defined exception (i.e. try..catch block)
    - Execution of the current function will stop 
        - The statements after throw won't be executed
        - The control will be passed to the first catch block in the call stack
        - If no catch block exists among caller functions, the program will terminate

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw)

    Syntax:

    throw expression;


- The try.. catch statement
    - It is comprised of a try block and either a catch block, a finally block, or both

    - The code in the try block is executed first
    - If it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed
    - The code in the finally block will always be executed 
        - Before control flow exits the entire construct

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

    Syntax:

    try {
    tryStatements
    } catch (exceptionVar) {
    catchStatements
    } finally {
    finallyStatements
    }


- Difference between an error and exception
    - Error is a plain JavaScript object

    - The moment that an error is thrown
        - It is referred as an exception
        - An exceptional situation that should NOT have happened
