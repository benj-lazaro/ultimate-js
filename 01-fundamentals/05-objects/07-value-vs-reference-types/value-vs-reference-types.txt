Value vs Reference Types
------------------------
- JavaScript have two (2) categories of types
    - Value types (i.e. Primitives)
        - Number
        - String
        - Boolean
        - Symbol (new in ES6)
        - undefined
        - null

    - Reference types
        - Object
        - Function
        - Array


- A primitive value when copied to another variable
    - The value is copied to the new variable
    - It is copied by their value

- A reference value when copied to another variable  
    - The address of the value in memory is copied to the new variable
    - It is copied by reference
    - Changes made in the value will be reflected on the value stored in the new variable
