Constructor Functions
---------------------
- Constructor functions is another pattern of creating objects
    - It uses Pascal naming convention

    - Instead of returning an object, it initializes an object

    - It employs the keyword "this"
        - The value of "this" is a reference to object that is executing this piece of code


- Objects in JavaScript are dynamic
    - Meaning that additional properties and/or methods at a later point in time


- To create a new object
    - The keyword "new" followed by the constructor function's name
        - This creates an empty JavaScript object

    - Through the use of "this" configures the empty object
        - Based on the defined properties and/or methods in the constructor function

    - Accepts any argument values that may have been passed
        - Assign the values to the corresponding properties and/or methods

    - Implicitly returns a new object with the passed value(s)


- Both the constructor and factory functions are equally good for creating objects
    - Constructor function pattern is familiar to developers with C# and Java experience
    - For the uninitiated, the factory function pattern is a good alternative
    - Pick one pattern and stick to it
