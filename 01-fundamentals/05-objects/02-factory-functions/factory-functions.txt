Factory Functions
-----------------
- Creating an object using the Object Literal Notation has its limits
    - Creating multiple copies of the same object results to code duplication
    - A bug present in a method will replicate to different places in the code
    - This can be addressed using a Factory Function


- A Factory Function is a function that create multiple objects from a single definition
    - It defines the object's properties and/or method(s)

    - It can accept argument values
        - That will be used by the object's properties and/or methods

    - It returns an object with different values assigned to properties or used by its methods
        - This is done without code duplication


- In modern JavaScript
    - When an object has an identifcal key and value name
        - Remove the ":" that separates the key and value names
        - Remove the value name
        - ONLY keeping the property name

    - Methods are also reduced by
        - Removing the ":" that separates the key & function body
        - Removing the "function" keyword
        - Basically, defining a normal function minus the keyword "function"
