Enumerating Properties of an Object
-----------------------------------
- There are several approaches in enumerating properties of an object
    - Using the for..in loop (commonly used approach)
        - Returns the object's properties / methods (keys) as well as its corresponding value
        

    - Using the for..of loop with Object.keys()
        - for..of loop ONLY works with iterables (e.g. arrays & maps)
            - NOT with objects since they are NOT iterable

        - Use Object.keys() method & pass the object as an arugment value
            - Returns a string array containing the properties / methods ONLY

        - Use Object.values() method & pass the object as an argument value
            - Returns a string array containing the corresponding values to keys ONLY


    - Using the for..of loop with Object.entries()
        - Returns each of the object's properties & values an an array
            - 1st element   = property / method
            - 2nd element   = corresponding value
        

- To check if a given property or method exists in an object
    - Use the "in" operator within a conditional statement
