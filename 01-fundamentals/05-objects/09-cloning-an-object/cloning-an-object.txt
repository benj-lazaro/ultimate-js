Cloning an Object
-----------------
- Three approaches to clone an existing object
    - Using for..in loop
        - The oldest approach


    - Using Object.assign() method
        - It takes one or more source objects
            - Then copies its properties / methods to the target object
            - Target object = empty or existing object

        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)

        - It has the advantage of adding new properties / methods to the target object


    - Using the spread "..." operator
        - Modern approach in cloning an object
        - Copies the properties / methods of the source object to the target object
