Constructure Property
---------------------
- Every object in JavaScript has a property called constructor
    - It simply references to the function that was used to create an object

    - When referenced, it returns the code of the function that was used to create an object

        <object_name>.constructor


- Creating an object using the Factory Function pattern, uses the Object Literal Notation

        const circle = createCircle();

    - This is equivalent to:
        
        const circle = {};

    - Behind the scenes, the JavaScript Engine calls the built-in constructor function Object()
    
        const circle = new Object()

    - Thus returning, the result of
    
        Object() { 
            [native code] 
        }

    
- Creating an object using the Constructor Function pattern
    - It simply returns the content of Construtor Function's code
