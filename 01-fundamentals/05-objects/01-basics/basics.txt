Basics
------
- Objects are collections of key-value pairs
    - These are referred to as properties and their corresponding assigned values

    - They can also stored functions that work with the proeprties
        - These are referred to as methods


- To create an object using the Object Literal Notation / Syntax

   <object_name> = {
        <property_1>: <value_1>,
        ...
        <property_n>: <value_n>,
        <method_name>: function() {
            // method code
        }
   }

    - Using this syntax is an easy way to create an object
        - However, as an app becomes more complex it needed a different way of creating


- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming
    - Wherein a program is a collection of objects
    - These objects "talk" to each other to perform some functionality


- Difference between a function and a method
    - Function is a piece of code that performs a specific task
    - Method is a basically function that is part of (and stored within) an object
