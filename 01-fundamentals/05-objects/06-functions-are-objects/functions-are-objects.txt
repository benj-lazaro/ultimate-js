Functions are Objects
---------------------
- In JavaScript, functions are objects
    - To prove it, refer to the app.js file

    - Another hint, on Visual Studio Code
        - After typing the function name 
        - Then followed by a "."
            - The purple icons refer to methods
            - The blue icons refer to properties

    - Accessing the "constructor" property
        - References the function that created the object
            - A built-in constructor named "Function"

            Function() { [native code] }

    

- The built-in .call() is a method of the Function instance
    - Calls this function with a given "this" value & arguments provided individually
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)


    - Everytime the "new" operator is used to create an object, internally
            - The JavaScript Engine creates an empty object
            - Pass that object as 1st argument to the .call() method
            - The passed object determines the context/value of "this" 

            - Omitting the "new" operator, JavaScript defaults referring to the global Window object


- The built-in .apply() is a method of the Function instance
    - Calls this function with a given "this" value & arguments provided as an array or array-like object
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)
