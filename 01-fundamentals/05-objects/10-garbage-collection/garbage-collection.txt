Garbage Collection
------------------
- JavaScript does NOT have a concept of Garbage Collection
    - The JavaScript Engine automatically allocates memory
        - When an object is created & initialized

    - When an object is NO longer in use
        - JavaScript Engine invokes its Garbage Collector
        - It figures out which variables, constants and/or objects that are NO longer in use
        - Then deallocates the memory that was allocated earlier

    - Garbage collection runs on some complex algorithm
        - It runs in the background and based on some complex algorithm
        - Developer and/or user has NO direct control over it
