Emptying an Array
-----------------
- There are four (4) ways to empty an Array

- Solution #1:
    - If the array is stored in a variable, NOT a constant
    
    - Assign a new empty array
        - The address of the new empty array is stored on the variable
        - Effectively empties the array
    
    - ONLY effective if the former array is NOT referenced anywhere in the code
        - Otherwise, it will remain in heap memory
        - The garbage collector will NOT remove it from memory


- Solution #2: (RECOMMENDED)
    - Accessing the .length property of the array
    - Assigning it with the value of 0
    - Effectively empties the array
        - This also reflects on the pieces of code referencing the former array


- Solution #3: (RECOMMENDED)
    - Using the .splice() method
    - Passing the index value of 0 as the 1st argument
    - Passing the .length property of the array
    - Effectively empties the array
        - This also reflects on the pieces of code referencing the former array


- Solution #4:
    - Using the .pop() method inside of a loop (e.g. while)
    - Effectively empties the array
        - This also reflects on the pieces of code referencing the former array

        - Individually popping element using a loop can be a performance cost
            - IF the array contains a significant number of elements
            - The code tends to be "noisy"
