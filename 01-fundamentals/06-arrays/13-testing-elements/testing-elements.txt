Testing the Elements of an Array
--------------------------------
- JavaScript has new methods that tests each elements of an array
    - .every()  = Returns true if every (all) elements matches the given criteria
    - .some()   = Returns true if at least one element matches the given criteria

    - NOTE: These methods are NOT supported by some older browsers


- The .every() is a method of the Array instances
    -  It tests whether ALL elements in the array pass the test 
        - Implemented by the callback function
        
        - If an element did NOT match the given criteria of the callback function
        - It IMMEDIATELY terminates the method and returns false

    - It returns a Boolean value
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)

    Syntax:

    every(callbackFn)
    every(callbackFn, thisArg)


- The .some() is a method of the Array instances
    - It tests whether AT LEAST one element in the array passes the test 
    - Implemented by the callback function

    - If an element did NOT match the given criteria of the callback function
    - It IMMEDIATELY terminates the method and returns true

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)

    Syntax:

    some(callbackFn)
    some(callbackFn, thisArg)
