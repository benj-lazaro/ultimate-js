Sorting Arrays
--------------
- To sort primitive elements in an array, use the methods
    - .sort()   = sorts the elements of an array in place
    - .reverse  = reverse sort the elements of an array in place


- The .sort() is a method of the Array instances
    - It sorts the elements of an array in place 
    - Returns the reference to the same array, now sorted
    - It converts elements into strings
        - Then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)

    Syntax:

    sort()
    sort(compareFn)


- The .reverse() is a method of the Array instances
    - It reverses an array in place and returns the reference to the same array
    - The first array element now becoming the last, and the last array element becoming the first
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)

    Syntax:

    reverse()


- To sort referencee type of elements using the .sort() method
    - Pass a callback function to be used for comparison, as an argument

    - The callback function takes two arguments
        - Representing the reference elements to be compared
        - Checks if the values are in right (sort) order
        - If NOT, re-arranges or sorts the reference elements

        - NOTE: Sorting is case-sensitive
            - To ensure uniformity, use .toLowerCase() or .toUpperCase() methods
