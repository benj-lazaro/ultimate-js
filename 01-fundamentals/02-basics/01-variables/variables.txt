Variables
---------
- A variable is one of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript
    - It stores data temporarily in the computer's memory
    
    - We give the memory location a name (i.e. variable name)
        - To read current data from said memory location in the future
        - To store new / updated data to


- To declare a variable
    - Use the keyword "let"
    - Followed by a name or identifier
    - Terminate the declaration with a semi-colon 

        let usename;

    - By default, a declared variable has an initial value of "undefined"

    - Optionally, a variable can be initialized with a value
        - Using the assignment operator "="
        - Followed by a value (e.g. string, number)

        let userName = "Mosh";


- Rules for naming a variable
    - The name can NOT be a reserved JavaScript keyword
        - e.g. const, let

    - The name should be meaningful and descriptive
        - Gives a clue on the purpose of the variable
        - Conveys what kind of data it is currently stored

    - The name can NOT start with a number

    - The name can NOT contain whitespace or hypen between words
        - Use the camelCase notation

    - The name is case-sensitive


- Declaring multiple variables can be performed in two (2) ways
    - Declare multiple variables in a single statement
        - Each variable separated by a comma
        - The entire statement is terminated by a semi-colon

        let firstName, lastName, middleName;

    - Declare each variable on their own line of code
        - Each variable declaration statement is terminated by a semi-colon
        - This is considered best practice

        let buildingNumber;
        let unitNumber;
        let streetName;
