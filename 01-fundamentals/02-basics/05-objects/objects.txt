Objects
-------
- An object is a Reference Type of data
    - It represents an object in real life


- To define an object
    - Use the Object Literal Notation syntax
    - Define the properies (key: value pairs) within the pair of { }
        - Each property is separate by a comma

    - An object is often assigned to a constant 

        const person = {
            name: "Mosh",
            age: 30,
        };


- Accessing an object's property can be done in two (2) ways:
    - Dot Notation
        - The object's name
        - Followed by a "."
        - Then the targeted property name

            person.name

    - Bracket Notation
        - The object's name
        - Followed by a pair of [ ]
        - Then the targeted property name inside the [ ]

            person[name]
