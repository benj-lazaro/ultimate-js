Types of Functions
------------------
- JavaScript functions are often divided into:
    - Perfoming a task
        - Displays content
        - Terminates the function

    - Performs a task and returns a value
        - Uses the keyword "return" to return a value
        - Terminates the function


- The JavaScript keyword "return"
    - It is a statement that ENDS a function execution
    - Followed by an expression that specifies a value to be returned to the function caller
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)

Syntax:

return;
return expression;


- A real-world JavaScript application is essentially a collection of functions
    - All working together to provide the functionality of an application
