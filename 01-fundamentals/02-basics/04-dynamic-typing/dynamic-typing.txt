Dynamic Typing
--------------
- There two types of programming languages
    - Static (statically-typed)
        - When a variable is declared, the type is set & it can NOT be changed in the future

    - Dynamic (Dynamically-typed)
        - When a variable is declared, the type is set but can be changed at run-time


- JavaScript is a dynamic language
    - It does NOT have two types of Number literal (NO integers and/or floating points)
    - ALL numbers are Number Literals


- The primitive value "undefined"
    - Is both a type and a value
    

- The "typeof" operator
    - It returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

    Syntax:

    typeof operand
