Dynamic Typing
--------------
- There two types of programming languages
    - Static (statically-typed)
        - When a variable is declared with a value
        - The data type of the value is set and can NOT be changed at runtime

    - Dynamic (Dynamically-typed)
        - When a variable is declared with a value
        - The data type of the value is set and can be changed at runtime


- JavaScript is a dynamic language
    - It does NOT have two specific types of Number Literals (i.e. integers and floats)
    - All numbers are considered Number Literals 


- The Primitive value "undefined" is BOTH a data type and value


- The "typeof" operator
    - Returns a string value
    - Indicating the data type of the operand's value
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

Syntax:

typeof <operand>
