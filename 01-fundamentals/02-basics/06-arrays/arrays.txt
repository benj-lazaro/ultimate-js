Arrays
------
- It is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object)
    - It can store multiple items under a single variable name
    - It is a data structure that represents a list of elements / items

    - Arrays are NOT primitives but reference types

    - An array is an object with the following core characteristics
        - It is resizeable and can contain a mix of different data types
        - It is NOT an associative array
        - It is zero-indexed
        - It can create shallow copies of itself

    - Since an array is an object
        - It has properties that can be accessed using the dot notation
